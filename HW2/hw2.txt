Homework 2 Due October 14, 2014

1. Given two arrays of points (with shapes (N, 2) and (M, 2)) where the columns are x and y,
respectively, write a function that returns an NxM matrix that defines the distance between
each of the points in one array to each of the points in the other array.  Make sure your
solution is vecorized (no loops!!!).

2. Use the point class described in class

 https://github.com/hetland/pg2014/blob/master/examples/point_example.py

 as a basis. Add a method that rotates the point clockwise by a specified number of radians
about another optional point, defaulting to the origin.  Tip:  Use operator overloading
to do math on the point to shift it over.

3. Create a 'high-pass' filter function that removes a trend from a given series of points
using a polynomial fit of order N (specified as a functional input, default is N=1 for a
linear fit). The function returns the difference between the given series and the polynomial
fit.

4. Create a class to read discharge data for the Brazos river from this page:
http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/dv?cb_00060=on&format=rdb&site_no=08116650&referred_module=sw&period=&begin_date=1967-10-01&end_date=2014-10-01

Store date (as an array of datetime objects) and discharge data (an array of floating point
numbers, converted to cubic meters per second) as attributes within the class.

Create methods to:

 - Extract a year of discharge data. Return dates and discharges for the specified year. 
 - Plot the hydrograph over the entire length of the timeseries.

5. Write a function to read the topography/bathymetry of the world using the ETOPO1 ice
surface dataset:

http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO1/data/ice_surface/grid_registered/xyz/ETOPO1_Ice_g_int.xyz.gz

and return three arrays representing x, y, and z. Write a script using this function to make
a pcolormesh map of the topo/bathy, and overlay the contours z = [-1000, 0, 1000]. The
negative contour should be thin and dashed, the 0 contour thick and solid, and the 1000
contour thin and solid.

ADVANCED QUESTION

6. Continue with the class created in question 4, adding the following methods:

 - Get a mean annual timeseries. Return the mean annual hydrograph with dates given for some
   arbitrary (specified) year. 
 - Create a plot of a given year with mean discharge and variability. Plot the given year as 
   a red line. Plot the annual mean hydrograph as a black line. Plot a grey shaded region around 
   the black line representing one standard deviation about the mean (use the plt.fill() command 
   for this).
